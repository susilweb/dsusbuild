                          Because Dynamics 365 is based on a monthly
                          subscription model, it's incredibly easy for your
                          business to scale up or down as needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This is particularly helpful for seasonal businesses
                          but also for fast-growing companies. As we've
                          experienced with many of our own customers, once
                          Dynamics 365 has been implemented, their operational
                          performance and productivity increase, thereby
                          requiring the need to scale up quickly. Dynamics 365
                          makes this a painless experience.

                          You'll be able to anticipate your monthly operational
                          costs. Because your organization is not on the hook
                          for a large yearly license, you'll never have to
                          commit to more than the number of licenses you need
                          for the individuals utilizing the solution. Even if
                          your business needs to scale up or down, the
                          predictability factor still remains.
