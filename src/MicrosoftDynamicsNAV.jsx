                      <p>Yes, Microsoft Dynamics is the same as Navision and is built on the same codebase, offering the same functionalities and was first introduced in 1984 as a simple tool with limited capabilities by Microsoft to cater for the needs of managing finance, accounts, warehouse, and debt management. From 1984 to 2017, NAV received several updates with lots of features. However, in 2018, Microsoft renamed Dynamics Navision as <NavLink to="/products/dynamics-365-business-central/">Dynamics 365 Business Central</NavLink> — an all-in-one cloud-based ERP software to manage your overall business by helping you make smarter business decisions.</p>

                      <p>It is difficult for anyone to estimate the <NavLink to="/dynamics-365-business-central-implementation/">Dynamics NAV implementation</NavLink> costs since no such available data can be validated as fixed pricing. Every business owner has different requirements and needs Dynamics NAV functionalities accordingly. For example, company size, industry type, number of users, active discounts and offers, and the storage required are the deciding factors for the Microsoft Dynamics NAV implementation pricing. However, for your ease of understanding and to provide you with an idea, the pricing of the Dynamics NAV cloud begins at <b>£180 a user/month</b>.</p>
