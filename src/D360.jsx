              <div className="custom002">
                <p>In 2016, Microsoft launched Dynamics 365, a next-gen integrated solution for all Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) needs, by merging Dynamics AX and the Dynamics CRM application. Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a unique all-in-one suite of cloud-based business apps/software modules that cater to changing trends, dropping the need to choose different ERP & CRM apps for your crucial business operations.</p>
                <p>With D365, you move your business towards more standardized and consistent database schematics - today's need. Moreover, the Common Data Model allows you to integrate Dynamics 365's different modules with other Microsoft Business Apps (Power BI (Business Intelligence), Power Apps, Outlook, Teams, and more) as well as any other app using a standard API (Application Programming Interface).</p>

              <div className="custom002">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Connecting data, business ops, and people for advanced business growth.</li>
                    <li>Making progressive/smart decisions using built-in AI (artificial intelligence), advanced analytics, and guided action suggestions for enhanced sales.</li>
                    <li>Leaning more towards adapting the app for your needs rather than altering the business processes/methods.</li>
                    <li>Options to integrate most applications with the existing ERP/CRM systems or customize with Microsoft Power Platform.</li>
                    <li>Availability and access to several business apps through Microsoft's AppSource - a platform like Google Play Store or Apple's App Store.</li>
                    <li>Opportunity to modernize your business by incorporating Microsoft Cloud, Azure services, mixed reality, AI/ML, social, and mobile capabilities for progressive business innovation.</li>
                    <li>Ease of access; users can run through a web browser and a working internet connection, whether on mobile or desktop devices.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Microsoft Cloud and Azure services have dropped the necessity of installing software on-premises. So, get your ERP/CRM app deployed on the cloud within a few months and start making an impact.</p>

                <p>Today, data safety is the primary concern for all business owners. After all, it's about building strong relationships with existing customers and attracting potential ones. Microsoft is increasingly investing in strengthening Dynamics 365 versions, which are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Business for small businesses </li>
                  <li>Dynamics 365 Enterprise for large industry</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Thus, based on your industry type and data storage facility from Microsoft Cloud & Azure services, you have the following data storage options:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Microsoft Dynamics online servers</li>
                  <li>Hosted Server (to store data on-premises or using private servers) </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Hosted Server costs you high compared to Microsoft's online servers. It is because setting up the on-premises or private servers costs you a ton of money and infrastructure, leaving loopholes for third-party attackers. Whereas Microsoft Azure ensures the safety and security of stored data and its transactions with strong encryption for the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online Servers. No need to worry about data safety. Microsoft has one of the strongest secure cloud networks.</p>
