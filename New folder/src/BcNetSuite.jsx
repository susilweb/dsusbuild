However, Dynamics 365 Business Central is not the sole cloud-based <NavLink to="/products/erp/">ERP solution</NavLink> in the market. Oracle NetSuite is another popular alternative.</p><p>Both Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and NetSuite are designed to help small and mid-sized organizations scale and grow their businesses. Therefore, organizations often find it difficult to select one that would cater to their needs.</p><p><b>This blog highlights the various aspects where Dynamics 365 Business Central edges out NetSuite.</b></p>

                <h2>Dynamics 365 Business Central vs NetSuite: The Difference</h2>
                <p>
                Here's a simple analogy to help you understand how Dynamics 365 is more suited to business needs than NetSuite.

                  <b>
                  A single phone line is being shared among multiple users. In such circumstances, it is difficult to:


                  </b>
                  <br /> <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Keep personal information private on a public line</li>
                    <li>
                      Assure that you do not lose phone access because of
                      someone else's blunder
                    </li>
                    <li>Manage upgrades without everyone being on board</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, a public phone line makes business operations clunky and
                  confusing.
                  <br /> <br />
                  NetSuite's multi-tenant software is more like these public
                  phone lines. The resources are shared by many users
                  simultaneously. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is completely
                  opposite. It is a single-tenant solution where every user gets
                  a unique environment to work.
