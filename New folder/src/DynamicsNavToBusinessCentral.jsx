                        Generally, when a business expands, it becomes difficult to manage the business processes with an outdated version of the ERP software solution. Similarly, if you are using the Dynamics NAV, you might face issues dealing with current business processes and optimizing them for better performance. There can be various reasons for lagging ERP software solution systems, like limited features and capabilities of NAV, no customizations, no integration, and no scalability. But Business Central got you covered with the best and updated features in terms of capabilities, customizations, and integrations to empower the current business processes. A Microsoft Dynamics NAV partner or Business Central Partner can help an organization update, add or build the specific customizations per specific requirements. Such customizations will help the business to perform complex tasks in simple ways.

                        With the Cloud deployment option of Business Central, you don't need to worry about the update or system upgrade manually. Because Microsoft automatically updates the whole system without bothering the user with the release of the new update. This makes the organizations run efficiently without hampering the working process for a smoother and more efficient workflow.</p><p>In the case of On-Premises deployment options, you need to be a little dependable on your ERP vendor partner. As Microsoft doesn't sell its services to the end customer, the certified vendor partner of NAV or Microsoft Dynamics Business Central, like Dynamics Square, comes into the role to provide any support services to the end users. </p>

                       <p>Most businesses have a ton of complex and unused data but want to transfer only some of it while upgrading to Business Central to carry out the important work. The standard upgrade is for such businesses. Not only the unused data, but such businesses can also eliminate the customized functions from transferring to the new servers of Business Central. This makes the whole system affordable, consuming less time, effort, and resources.</p>

                Maybe, you want to upgrade only a feature of your existing NAV version rather than upgrading the whole system. If so, you can easily upgrade the feature, whether it belongs to the financial capabilities or the integrations. In such a case, you can contact the Business Central Implementation partner, like Dynamics Square, to upgrade a feature of your current version of Dynamics NAV.
