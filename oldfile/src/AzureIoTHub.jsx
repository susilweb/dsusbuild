            <p>
            Azure IoT Hub is referred to as a scalable managed service embedded with a bidirectional messaging hub hosted on the cloud. It allows you to build highly secure and reliable communication between hosted IoT applications and configured equipment. Enterprises can connect millions of devices configured with specific solutions to monitor devices and represent device performance reading on the app dashboard.
