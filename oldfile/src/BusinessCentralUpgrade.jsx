                      Upgrading Business Central on-premises means going online
                      or configuring your set-up on-cloud. Data can be migrated
                      from the earlier versions of Business Central such as 14,
                      15, 16, and 17. Current users can also switch to cloud
                      from version 19.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      To upgrade Business Central on-premises, you are required
                      to set up a connection between your Business Central
                      on-premises wherein you can manage cloud migration by
                      going through Cloud Migration Management Page.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The next step is to manage data migration by running the
                      migration tool. This process goes can be performed in a
                      single step but with limited options of migration
                      troubleshooting. To run customized migration suited to
                      your specific data transformation needs, experts at
                      Dynamics Square can help.

                      <br />
                      You can run on-premises data migration in two steps:
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Data Replication</strong>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This is the step that starts when you allow 'Set Up Cloud
                      Migration'. Once the process reaches to end, you will have
                      the backup or copy of the on-premises data through you can
                      very whether the migration went successful or not.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>Data Upgrade</strong>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      This is the process that starts when you allow 'Run Data
                      Upgrade Now' using the 'Cloud Migration Management Page'
                      in your Business Central account.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      After a successful migration, you are needed to test the
                      performed data migration. To perform so, you need to run
                      the data replication and then create a 'Sandbox'
                      environment to ensure a safer data upgrade.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      To run data migration, you are required to have hard-core
                      technical expertise in Business Central Data Migration. At
                      Dynamics Square, we can perform such data migration as
                      customized as suited to your current as well as futuristic
                      business needs while applying secure, and productive
                      methodologies.
